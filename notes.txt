Create and switch to new feature branch:

git checkout -b feature/add-search

Make your changes and commit them:

git add .
git commit -m "added search functionality"

Push your feature branch:

git push origin feature/add-search

When feature is working:

Go to GitHub website
You'll usually see a yellow banner suggesting to "Compare & pull request" for your recently pushed branch
Click that button
Add a simple description like "Added search functionality to recipe page"
Click "Create pull request"
Since it's your project, you can immediately click "Merge pull request"


Clean up locally:

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/add-search
This simplified version gives you practice with:

Creating branches
Working with pull requests
Basic GitHub workflow
Keeping your code organized

It's a great way to build good habits for when you work on team projects later! Would you like me to create a more detailed example with a specific feature?
